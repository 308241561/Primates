One run of my program in a simple text fileThe Jungle Friends Primate Sanctuary provides a permanent home and high-quality sanctuary care for New World primates who have been cast-off from the pet trade, retired from research, or confiscated by authorities.Let me show you how this program works to make the management easier!<<<<<<=============================================================>>>>>>Step 1: Found some monkeys in the new world.
